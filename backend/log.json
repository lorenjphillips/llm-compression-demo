Check the website for a support phone number.\n\n4. **Email Support:** Sending an email to the support team can also be a way to describe your problem in detail. It may take longer to get a response, however.\n\n5. **Social Media:** Some companies provide support through their social media channels like Twitter or Facebook. You can try reaching out there if other methods fail.\n\n6. **Online Forums/Communities:** Sometimes community forums related to the service can provide guidance or direct ways to reach human support.\n\nIf I can assist you with any specific steps or have additional related questions, feel free to ask!",

This is a critical component in designing an AI system as it establishes the framework within which the AI operates. Here's a breakdown of each aspect mentioned:\n\n1. **Generate Workflows & Conversation Flows**: This involves outlining the paths and interactions the agent can take during a conversation. It includes designing process maps that help the AI understand different user inputs and respond appropriately through various stages of interaction.\n\n2. **Define Responses to Different Scenarios**: For this, you create specific guidelines or scripts for how the agent should act in various situations, including common questions, troubleshooting, and error recovery. This helps ensure your agent is consistent and effective.\n\n3. **Set the Tone & Personality of the Agent**: You must decide on the personality traits of the agent. Whether the tone is formal, casual, friendly, or professional depends on the target audience and the context of use. This will guide how the agent crafts its responses.\n\n4. **Establish Guidelines for Handling User Interaction**: Setting clear rules about how to manage challenging situations, such as handling abusive language, addressing misunderstandings, or escalating issues to a human representative, helps in maintaining quality and user satisfaction.\n\nOverall, the system prompt serves as the initial advising input that shapes the AI's operational strategy and response dynamics. To build a robust system prompt, consider conducting user research, gathering input from stakeholders, and iterating based on feedback and performance analysis.",
